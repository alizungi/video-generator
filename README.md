# Video Generator Project

This Python project generates a short video from an image as Requested in the assignment, applying transformations (like grayscale or rotation), overlaying text, and adding background music. The video also includes captions and voiceover narration.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to use Python and various libraries (like **MoviePy** and **Pillow**) to:
1. Load an image.
2. Overlay text on the image.
3. Apply a transformation (grayscale, rotation, resize).
4. Convert the image into a short video clip with background music.
5. Add captions and a voiceover narration.

### Python Version

- Python 3.12.1

### Libraries

- **moviepy**: For video editing and manipulation.
- **pillow**: For image processing (loading, transformations, etc.).
- **imageio**: To read and write video files.
- **proglog**: For logging.
- **numpy**: For handling numerical operations.

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pillow gtts moviepy

To Run the assignmet run:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
python script.py
